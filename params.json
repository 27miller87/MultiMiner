Your way.\r\nMultiMiner is a GUI front-end for [cgminer][1] and [bfgminer][2] that simplifies switching individal devices - GPUs, ASICs, etc. - between crypto-currencies.\r\n\r\nMultiMiner will automatically download and install either cgminer, bfgminer, or both.\r\n\r\n![No Miners Prompt](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/No%20Miners%20Prompt.png \"No Miners Prompt\")\r\n\r\n![Downloading and Installing Cgminer](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Downloading%20and%20Installing%20Cgminer.png \"Downloading and Installing Cgminer\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner uses the underlying mining engine (cgminer by default) to detect available mining devices.\r\n\r\n![Main Screen](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Main%20Screen.png \"Main Screen\")\r\n\r\nYou can then use the UI to configure individual crypto-currencies and their pools, including support for load balancing.\r\n\r\n![Configure Coins](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Configure%20Coins.png \"Configure Coins\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner supports automatically mining the most profitable coins based on a set of configurable strategies.\r\n\r\n![Configure Strategies](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Configure%20Strategies.png \"Configure Strategies\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner also supports basic features such as relaunching crashed miners, starting with Windows, minimizing to the notification area, and mining on startup.\r\n\r\n![Settings](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Settings.png \"Settings\")\r\n\r\nFinally, MultiMiner supports [MobileMiner][14], an open API with mobile apps for remotely monitoring and controlling your rigs.\r\n\r\n![MobileMiner](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/MobileMiner.png \"MobileMiner\")\r\n\r\nBinary Downloads\r\n----------------\r\nRefer to the [Github Releases page][12] for source code and binary downloads.\r\n\r\nWindows Installation\r\n--------------------\r\n1. Download and run the installer at the above link and follow instructions\r\n\r\nThe installer runs without needing admin rights and does not install to Program Files so as not to be too intrusive.

Launch MultiMiner.Win.exe to get started\r\n\r\nOS X Installation\r\n-----------------\r\n1. Install X11. Under OS X you should install Xquartz available [here][7]\r\n2. Install the latest version of [Mono][8]\r\n3. Download and extract the __.app__.zip file at the above Binary Downloads link\r\n4. Launch MultiMiner.app to get started\r\n\r\n![No Miners Prompt - OS X](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/No%20Miners%20Prompt%20-%20OS%20X.png \"No Miners Prompt - OS X\")\r\n\r\nMultiMiner will automatically download redistributable binaries of cgminer and bfgminer from the [xgminer-osx][13] project.\r\n\r\n![Main Screen - OS X](https://github.com/nwoolls/MultiMiner/raw/master/Screenshots/Main%20Screen%20-%20OS%20X.png \"Main Screen - OS X\")\r\n\r\nMono (OS X, Linux) Installation\r\n-------------------------------\r\n1. Download and extract the zip file at the above Binary Downloads link\r\n2. Install cgminer or bfgminer. For OS X, you can find packages and for doing so [here][5] and instructions for using them [here][6].\r\n3. Install X11. Under OS X you should install Xquartz available [here][7].\r\n4. Install the latest version of [Mono][8].\r\n5. Run MultiMiner.Win.exe using mono:\r\n\r\n        mono MultiMiner.Win.exe\r\n        \r\nSource Code\r\n-----------\r\nThe source code is structured in such a way that it should be fairly easy to use and re-use for other projects:\r\n\r\n* __MultiMiner.Xgminer__ is an assembly for controling either the cgminer or bfgminer executable - e.g. launching and enumerating devices\r\n* __MultiMiner.Xgminer.Api__ assists in communicating with the underlying miner via the RPC API\r\n* __MultiMiner.Coinchoose.Api__ assists in consuming the cypto-currency information available at [coinchoose.com][9]\r\n* __MultiMiner.Engine__ is an assembly that can be used to interact with all functionality found in MultiMiner, but without a UI - useful for creating front-ends for other OS's\r\n* __MultiMiner.Win__ is the Windows Forms application\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Nathanial Woolls\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
